This Julia lab manual goes with the notes for ROB 101, Computational Linear Algebra. Julia is used to transform the theory learned in the course into effective algorithms, or code! The course assumes no prior experience with programming. For those with prior knowledge of MATLAB or C++, Appendices~\ref{App:FromMatlab2Julia} and \ref{App:FromC2Julia} provide hints to help you acquire more quickly some fluency in Julia. A summary of the key Julia commands used in the course is given in Appendix~\ref{App:JuliaCommands}.
