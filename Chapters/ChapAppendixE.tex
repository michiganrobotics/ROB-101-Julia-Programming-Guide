\bf \large We provide this information as a service. We do not have enough staff to provide IT support for your personal Julia installations. Now, some of your fellow classmates are probably able and happy to help you. Post on Piazza for help, but do not expect ROB 101 Staff to respond unless they have a free moment.

There is basic information on the F-21 ROB 102 webpage:  \url{https://robotics102.github.io/tutorials/setup.html#install_julia}? \\

Professor Grizzle strongly recommends Anaconda as the user interface \url{https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html}. It allows you to work with the same jupyter notebooks we use in ROB 101. Of course, you will not be able to directly download Labs, HWs, or Projects from the ROB 101 Canvas Site, nor will you be able to submit assignments through your personal installation. Please keep these points in mind.
